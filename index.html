      <p>Vishal grew up along the Pennsylvania Appalachia where he experienced feelings of biophilia at a young age, leading him to establish a strong connection with the natural environment. He attended The Pennsylvania State University for two years before transferring to the University of California—Berkeley where he received a B.S. in Evolutionary Biogeography & Anthropology as well as a minor in Geospatial Information Science & Technology. He began his journey with DEVELOP at the NASA Ames Research Center after which he assumed a role as Project Coordination Fellow and Assistant Center Lead at the Mobile County Health Department. He currently resides at the NASA Langley Research Center. In his spare time, Vishal enjoys many things: Reading, listening to music, being physically active, pursuing a spiritual lifestyle, and working towards creating a more socially just and ecologically minded global community—to name just a few. His future plans include receiving either a PhD/ MBA or remaining within the professional work environment.</p>
